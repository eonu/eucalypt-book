# Blog environment

### CLI tasks

* [Setup](../../cli/blog/setup.md)

### Description

The framework comes with the option to set up a static blog environment.

The environment allows the creation of articles \(along with a separate asset sub-directory for each individual article\), editing of article metadata, deletion of articles, searching for articles \(by tag and by date\).

Once set up, the following files would have been generated:

* Blog helper
* Blog controller \(for article route handling\)
* Layout file for articles
* Blog view \(that should display all articles\)
* Blog search view \(searching for articles by tags\)
