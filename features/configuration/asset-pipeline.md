# Asset pipeline

### Location

The asset pipeline constitutes the `app/assets` directory.

The configuration file can be found at `config/asset_pipeline.rb`.

### Description

By default, the `assets` sub-directories: `stylesheets`, `scripts`, `images` and `fonts` are included in the asset pipeline.

If [setting up a blog environment](../../cli/blog/setup.md) for your application, then the `blog` sub-directory is also included in the asset pipeline.

You can add a new directory by changing the configuration file.
